## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This project helped me in learning on how to go about planning the layout of the project. It took me sometime to figure out how I wanted to go about completing this project. I was between flexbox and grid and I'm still not sure if I did things right and will likely redo this project to improve things. It was also good practice with react, sending state and values through props. I also added Material UI for the text feild for the styling.


### Continued development

I hope to keep learning how to code CSS better as well as to use Semantic HTML so that my sites have proper structure. I also want to continue learning React and look foward to understanding context and React Router.
